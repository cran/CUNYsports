# CUNYsports

`CUNYsports` is an R package for accessing and exploring collegiate athletics data from the **City University of New York (CUNY)**.

The package provides a simple interface for retrieving sports data from an included SQLite database. The database contains information about teams, players, games, seasons, schools, opponents, and other aspects of CUNY athletics.

**Currently, only basketball related data is available. However, work is being done to include *all* sports.**

The project is part of the **CUNY Sports Analytics Initiative** at [The Open Data Lab](https://martinezc1-nyc-open-data-lab.share.connect.posit.cloud/).

## Overview

CUNY athletics data are publicly available across individual college athletics websites, however, the data is not very accessible.

`CUNYsports` provides a centralized and reproducible way to work with these data in R.

The package includes:

- A SQLite database containing cleaned CUNY athletics data
- Functions for discovering available tables
- Search tools for finding relevant datasets
- Table-level documentation
- Column-level documentation
- Functions for retrieving complete tables into R
- Direct database access for advanced users

The package is designed to support sports analytics, student research, dashboards, scouting reports, data visualization, teaching, and other analyses of CUNY athletics.

## Sports Coverage

The initial release of `CUNYsports` focuses on **CUNY men's and women's basketball**.

Basketball data include:

- Team statistics
- Player statistics
- Conference statistics
- Scoring statistics
- Player averages
- Game-by-game statistics
- Opponent statistics
- Team game highs
- Individual game highs
- Category leaders
- Schools, seasons, players, games, and opponents

The project is designed to expand to additional CUNY sports over time.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `CUNYsports` from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("nyc-open-data-lab/CUNYsports")
```

Then load the package:

``` r
library(CUNYsports)
```

## Getting Started

`CUNYsports` provides a small set of functions for exploring and accessing the database.

### View Available Tables

Use `cuny_table_names()` to see all tables currently available in the database.

``` r
cuny_table_names()
```

This is a useful starting point when exploring the package.

### Search for Tables

If you know what kind of data you want but do not know the exact table name, use `cuny_find_tables()`.

For example:

``` r
cuny_find_tables("basketball")
```

You can also search for more specific topics:

``` r
cuny_find_tables("player")
cuny_find_tables("game")
cuny_find_tables("scoring")
```

The function searches the package's table catalog and returns tables whose metadata match the search term.

### Learn About a Table

Once you identify a table of interest, use `cuny_table_info()` to view its documentation.

``` r
cuny_table_info("basketball_all_seasons_player_overall_final")
```

Table metadata include information such as:

- Description
- Data grain
- Season coverage
- Source
- Potential keys and relationships
- Likely analytical uses
- Additional notes

### Learn About the Columns

Use `cuny_columns_info()` to view documentation for the variables contained in a table.

``` r
cuny_columns_info("basketball_all_seasons_player_overall_final")
```

The column catalog provides information such as:

- Column name
- Suggested name
- Data type
- Description
- Example values
- Key type
- Additional notes

### Pull a Table into R

Use `cuny_pull_table()` to retrieve a complete database table as an R data frame.

``` r
player_stats <- cuny_pull_table(
  "basketball_all_seasons_player_overall_final"
)
```

You can then work with the data using standard R tools:

``` r
library(dplyr)

player_stats |>
  filter(gender == "W")
```

or:

``` r
player_stats |>
  filter(gender == "M")
```

## Typical Workflow

A typical `CUNYsports` workflow looks like this:

``` r
library(CUNYsports)
library(dplyr)

# See what data are available
cuny_table_names()

# Find player-related tables
cuny_find_tables("player")

# Read documentation for a table
cuny_table_info(
  "basketball_all_seasons_player_overall_final"
)

# Examine its columns
cuny_columns_info(
  "basketball_all_seasons_player_overall_final"
)

# Retrieve the data
players <- cuny_pull_table(
  "basketball_all_seasons_player_overall_final"
)

# Begin analysis
players |>
  filter(gender == "W")
```

This workflow can be thought of as:

``` mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["Discover"] --> B["Understand"] --> C["Retrieve"] --> D["Analyze"]

    A --- A1["cuny_table_names()<br/>cuny_find_tables()"]
    B --- B1["cuny_table_info()<br/>cuny_columns_info()"]
    C --- C1["cuny_pull_table()"]
    D --- D1["Your analysis"]
```

## Database Structure

`CUNYsports` stores its athletics data in an included SQLite database.

The database uses a relational structure consisting of analytical tables and reusable dimension tables.

### Basketball Tables

The current basketball database contains tables covering:

- Season-level team statistics
- Player overall statistics
- Player conference statistics
- Player scoring statistics
- Player averages
- Team summary statistics
- Game-by-game team statistics
- Game-by-game opponent statistics
- Game-by-game comparisons
- Team game highs
- Individual game highs
- Category leaders

*Men's* and *women's* basketball records are stored together and can be distinguished using the `gender` variable.

### Dimension Tables

Shared dimension tables provide standardized identifiers and attributes for entities used throughout the database.

These include:

- `dim_seasons`
- `dim_schools`
- `dim_players`
- `dim_games`
- `dim_opponents`
- `dim_player_year`

These dimensions support consistent joins and longitudinal analyses across the database.

## Direct Database Access

Advanced users can access the SQLite database directly with `cuny_db()`.

``` r
con <- cuny_db()
```

For example:

``` r
DBI::dbListTables(con)
```

The connection can also be used with database-backed workflows:

``` r
dplyr::tbl(
  con,
  "basketball_all_seasons_player_overall_final"
)
```

When finished, disconnect from the database:

``` r
DBI::dbDisconnect(con)
```

For most users, `cuny_pull_table()` provides the simplest way to retrieve data.

## Data Documentation

Two catalogs are included with the package:

### `table_catalog`

Contains table-level metadata describing the structure, coverage, relationships, and potential uses of each table in the database.

### `column_catalog`

Contains column-level metadata describing variables within each database table, including their meaning, data type, example values, and role within the database.

The helper functions `cuny_table_info()` and `cuny_columns_info()` provide convenient interfaces to these catalogs.

## Data Sources

The underlying data are derived from publicly available CUNY athletics websites.

The data engineering pipeline collects and standardizes information across CUNY institutions before constructing relational tables for distribution through the package.

Because websites vary across CUNY schools and seasons, the project includes cleaning and standardization to make cross-school and analysis easier.

## CUNY Sports Analytics Initiative

`CUNYsports` is part of the **CUNY Sports Analytics Initiative**, a project of The Open Data Lab focused on building open data infrastructure for CUNY athletics.

The broader initiative uses these data to support projects including:

- Sports analytics
- Historical analysis
- Scouting reports
- Interactive dashboards
- Student research
- Data visualization
- Open-source software
- Sports journalism and storytelling

The goal is not to collect athletics data, but to make those data easier for students, researchers, coaches, fans, and the broader CUNY community to explore and use.

## Future Development

Planned areas of development include:

- Additional CUNY sports
- Expanded historical coverage
- Additional helper functions
- Improved database documentation
- Automated data validation
- Testing infrastructure
- Tutorials and example analyses
- Integration with CUNY sports dashboards and other public-facing projects
